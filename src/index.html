Any attempt by you to obtain more than two (2) entries per Entry Period by using multiple/different email addresses, Instagram Accounts, Twitter Accounts, identities, registrations or logins, or any other methods may void your entries and you may be disqualified from the Promotion. Any use of robotic, repetitive, automatic, programmed or similar entry methods or agents (including, but not limited to, sweepstakes entry services) will void all entries by you.
